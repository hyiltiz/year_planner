## Yearly planner for 2022

Achievements start with good planning. This is a weekly planner. 

### Steps to use
1. Copy-paste to anywhere (Google Doc, Word, Notes, a piece of paper, Emacs etc.)
1. Write down your plans for the month in the month row and break it down to each week. 
1. You can use the comment column to 
    - mark what you need to be mindful of before the week,
    - give yourself a satisfaction score after the week, 
    - or what you learned after the week.
1. Print it and stick it on your fridge. Or, if you want to reduce your carbon footprint, save it to your Desktop / mobile device where you can see it without any extra effort.
1. Keep track of your progress by checking if you are lagging behind your plans at least once a week.
1. No plan works unless it fits the circumstances. Adjust your plans as needed. 
    - If you need to make big adjustments, simply do so then re-print. Then commit to your new plan.
    - Try not to make too frequent adjustments.

## How does it work?
This python script creates a concise weekly calendar for any specified
year. The calendar functionality is provided via BSD calendar `ncal`.
This script reformats its output to make it less redundant. Here is what
the planner for the year 2022 looks like:

As a bonus, if you are a [orgmode](https://orgmode.org/ "orgmode") user, you can
take advantage of everything that org provides for this calendar.
